# SMS-Serial-Number-Verification-Project

- This project is similar to [Jadi's sms serial verification project](https://github.com/jadijadi/sms_serial_verification) and I followed [Jadi Videos](https://www.aparat.com/v/fAZSV?playlist=288572&%D8%AA%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C%D8%AF_%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%85%DA%A9%DB%8C_%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87_%D8%B3%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%A7%D9%84_-_%DB%B0%DB%B0%DB%B1_-_%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B9_%D9%BE%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%87) to do this project.
- This project is exactly about a system that receives SMS from customers to validate that a hologram of a product that sends from the customer is valid or not. If the SMS is valid, the system will be answered to customers that the product is original. 
- I used the following technologies for this project:
    1. Python
    2. Flask
    3. Kavehnegar SMS services for receiving and sending SMS
    4. Fandogh Paas 
    5. Postgresql
